colors: Instead of the naive freq-to-rgb routine in color.c
have an actual palette that e.g. GnuPlot etc must use.

Specify paper size (A4 by default) and the bounding box.
See what e.g. mandoc does in the preambule.

Can we be clever about the size of dots and fonts?
With a few dots, they can be bigger, with a crowded plot,
they should be smaller. Or let the user say?
